### Objective
The objective of the Quatroah team is to work on developing a website that displays scores, standings, and relevant news aggregated from your favorite teams. Hosted on Firebase

API implemented from Balldontlie to receive teams, scores and data to make predictions.
A search field to look up teams and show their latest matches
An option to sign up and pick a favorite team to get their relevant information on the home page

### Target Audience
Our target audience includes anyone with an interest in the NBA from old to young ages.

### How it will meet the functionality:

- Everyone can log in/create an account. With an account, you can pick your favorite teamsand can get relevant information for those teams rather than a general news flash
- We are thinking of having the functionality to change a userâ€™s password and profile information.
