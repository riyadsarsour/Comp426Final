# Quatroah 
### Objective
The objective of the Quatroah team is to work on developing a website that displays scores, standings, and relevant news aggregated from your favorite teams. We will implement API from popular sources such as ESPN to show up-to-date data from players chosen teams. We will also implement an algorithm to display NBA and NFL winning rates and update it periodically with latest predictions. It also will predict the wins/losses of different opponent match ups, allowing logged in users to monitor different games.

### Target Audience
Our target audience includes anyone with an interest in sports from old to young ages.

### How it will meet the functionality:
- We will have a search field for teams/players and can have suggestions coming up
- Everyone can log in/create an account. With an account, you can pick your favorite teams/players and can get relevant information for those teams rather than a general news flash
- We are thinking of having the functionality to change a userâ€™s password and profile information.
- We are thinking of hosting our project on Firebase and therefore accessing a dynamic data source
- ESPN has a lot of available APIs, along with others that we are considering to display predictions, scores and standings of teams and players.

	- Real-time Database
	- Cloud Functions

- NodeJS (integrated with Firebase)
- Bulma or Bootstrap (CSS)

### Programming Languages/Libraries Needed:
